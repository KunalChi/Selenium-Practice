/* Poylmorphism permits any number of methods to define its own implementation based on
one interface. A superclass contains the method's structure while subclass determine how
to implement the structure
*/
/* Interface is a collection of related methods.
Generally interfaces do not include the body of a method. Therefore an interface method 
reveals what action to perform but not how to perform the action. This concept allows a class 
to implement the interface method and decide how to perform the action.
